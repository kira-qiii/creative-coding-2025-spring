      6 March, 2024, I left for the Netherlands to visit my friend, who had been my classmate since high school to undergrad, and now is an international student in the Netherlands. She studies in Eindhoven and lives in a small city in Den Bosch.

    It was afternoon when I got off the train. The weather there is unpredictable. It was snowing heavily when I arrived, and by the time I settled into my friend's studio, the sun was already out. Here's the dreamlike sunset from her window.
  </div>
  <div>Den Bosch is a peaceful little town. There's some stores and restaurants in the downtown area, and a church that rings its bells on the hour. This small gold dragon sculpture is a landmark of this place.

  <div>This museum feels more like a theme park than a traditional exhibition of the artist Hieronymus Bosch. There're replicas, installations and status of his works. One of the best things about this place was its rooftop, offering a panoramic view of the entire town.</div>

      Over the next few days, I explored more cities—The Hague, Utrecht, and, of course, Amsterdam. Each had its own charm, with a mix of beautifully preserved historical buildings and sleek modern architecture.

    <p style="color: rgb(115, 115, 115);">I'll quickly move on since 15 mins is short so I'd like to leave enough time for the wonderful Barcelona.</span>

<h2>04. Welcome to Barcelona</h2>

<div class="container2">
  <div>
    <p>
      Barcelona is a perfect place for vacation - There're mountains, beaches, historical architecture, Tapas, Paella and gelatos, and very well-organized streets. The weather is also pleasantly warmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I actually didn't have much time to stay, and spring break always feels too short, but fortunately the sights in Barcelona are so compact that I got around easily. The public traffic is convenient but generally I prefer walking over taking the subway—wandering through the streets is the best way to experience the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my first day there, it rained, and the reflections of the sky and tree shadows on Barcelona's iconic floral patterned floor tiles.

<h2>05. Mountains, Ocean, and Alleys</h2>

<div class="container2">
  <div>
     <p>
      Barcelona is in a perfect location—mountains on one side, the sea on the other. Depending on where you stand, you can take in both the vibrant city streets and the peaceful coastline.
    </p>
    </div>
  <div>
    <p>
     Buildings here are tightly packed yet orderly, with winding alleyways that reminded me of my hometown, Suzhou. From the church atop Tibidabo Hill, you can see both the city and the sea. I stayed there until twilight, watching as the city lights flickered on.
    </p>

<h2>06. La Sagrada Família</h2>

    <p>
      Known far and wide as La Sagrada Família. Words feel inadequate to describe this masterpiece. The interior isn't particularly large, but I still spent the entire afternoon there. It takes real effort to walk away from something so mesmerizing.

          I took way too many photos and still haven't finished sorting through them. But going through them again gives me a chance to relive the trip. I'll end this with a shot from my flight home said to be the snow-covered Pyrenees.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large; font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
          Thank you for watching.
